Space Cowboys Project
This project focuses on processing images through multiple stages to enhance quality and surface visualization, tailored specifically for the Space Cowboys initiative.

Project Overview
Image Format Conversion
The first step involves converting the image from its original format to TIFF using OpenCV.

Grayscale Conversion
Once converted to TIFF, the image is further processed into grayscale for subsequent steps.

Image Enhancement Using LL Flow Model
The grayscale image is enhanced using the LL Flow model for better quality.

Surface Visualization Using ResNet-18
The enhanced image is visualized graphically using ResNet-18, revealing surface details.

SNR Conversion
Finally, the grayscale image is converted to an SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) format to obtain a detailed, enhanced image.
